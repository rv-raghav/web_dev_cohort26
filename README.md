Alright, time to make the **root README** look like it belongs to a repo that knows where it’s going, not a junk drawer with commits.

Below is an **updated, structured README** that:

- Explains the purpose of the repo
- Documents the **current folder structure**
- Clearly states **what each folder is for**
- Is future-proof for when more folders get added

You can paste this directly into `README.md`.

# web_dev_cohort26

This repository documents my **6-month structured journey into full-stack web development** through the **Chai Code cohort**.

It covers web fundamentals, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, databases, DevOps, and production-grade projects, with a strong focus on **clean code**, **scalable architecture**, and **real-world engineering practices**.

This repository is designed to grow progressively as concepts are learned and applied.

## 📚 Folder Overview

### `blogs/`

This folder contains links to **technical blogs** written as part of learning and revision.

Each subfolder represents a topic and includes a `README.md` with:

- Blog context
- Key topics covered
- External links to published blogs (Hashnode)

**Current topics:**

- `git-github/` – Version control concepts and workflows
- `networking/` – Internet, DNS, HTTP, and client-server fundamentals
- `html/` – HTML structure, semantics, and best practices
- `css/` – Styling fundamentals and layout concepts

---

### `building-blocks/`

This folder contains **hands-on practice and assignments** related to foundational web technologies.

#### `building-blocks/assignments/`

Holds assignment-based implementations mapped to specific topics.

- `html/`
  - `resume.html`
    - **Assignment 1: HTML Resume Page**
    - Built using **only HTML**
    - No CSS or JavaScript
    - Uses semantic HTML tags to structure content correctly

This section focuses on applying concepts practically rather than theoretical notes.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

- Track structured learning progress over 6 months
- Practice concepts through assignments and mini-projects
- Document understanding via blogs and explanations
- Build a solid foundation for full-stack and production-level development
