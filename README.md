# web_dev_cohort26

This repository documents my **6-month structured journey into full-stack web development** through the **Chai Code cohort**.

It covers web fundamentals, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, Node.js, databases, DevOps, and production-grade projects, with a strong focus on **clean code**, **scalable architecture**, and **real-world engineering practices**.

This repository is designed to grow progressively as concepts are learned and applied.
